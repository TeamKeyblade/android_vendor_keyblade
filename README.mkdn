Swordrune10's vendor file
=========================
<br/>
A word about vendor/swordrune10(my own device file inside rooted and busyboxed aosp):
_____________________________________________________________________________________
it works by making Android.mk file execute a bash script, which sets up superuser dependencies and attaches a call to overrider.mk file to full_(the device ur building).mk
currently the directory is messy and doesnt do much other then make sure superuser builds and make your build rom manager ready
i plan on making it a rather independent device vendor and adding other stuff too
